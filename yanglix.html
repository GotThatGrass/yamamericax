      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Yanglix is the sacred language gifted to the Kypwatchidwax by the legendary
          King Pwatchidwax. According to the first book of the <i>Yqmaqmiax</i>, the King 
          spoke the First Word in the darkness before the world formed. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Every word in Yanglix is therefore treated as spiritually significant. 
          To speak is to recreate the King's creative act, and many ceremonial 
          traditions revolve around the careful recitation of sacred text.
        </p>

        <p>
          Historically, Yanglix was reserved only for ritual speech, administration, 
          and legal inscriptions. A simplified form later developed for daily use, 
          but the classical register is still preserved in scripture and performance.
        </p>

      <!-- ORTHOGRAPHY AND PHONOLOGY -->
      <section>
        <h3>The Phonological Inventory and Orthography</h3>
        <p>
          Yanglix uses a distinctive orthography based on a modified Latin script.
          Although written with the same letters familiar to English users, several
          letters represent different or shifted sounds. Consonants dominate the
          sound system due to the mythic tradition that the First Word itself was 
          spoken without vowels.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Consonant Letters and Their Core Values</h4>
          <p>Yanglix traditionally recognizes the following consonants:</p>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Aa - used mainly for /a/ or schwa in liturgical pronunciation</li>
            <li>Bb - /b/</li>
            <li>Cc - /k/ or /tʃ/ when doubled (cc → /tʃ/)</li>
            <li>Dd - /d/</li>
            <li>Gg - /g/</li>
            <li>Ii - functions historically as both vowel /i/ and consonant /j/</li>
            <li>Jj - /dʒ/</li>
            <li>Kk - /k/</li>
            <li>Mm - /m/</li>
            <li>Nn - /n/</li>
            <li>Oo - reduced /o/ or /u/ depending on environment</li>
            <li>Pp - /p/</li>
            <li>Qq - a deeper /q/ sound used in sacred reading</li>
            <li>Ss - pronounced /ts/</li>
            <li>Tt - /t/ → becomes /d/ after /n/ and unstressed</li>
            <li>Ww - /w/</li>
            <li>Xx - /ks/ or /kʃ/ in careful speech</li>
            <li>Yy - /j/, often silent after tense consonants</li>
            <li>Zz - /dz/</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Vowels and Sonorants</h4>
          <p>
            While Yanglix is not fully vowelless, vowels serve a supportive role.
            In rapid ceremonial recitation, many vowels reduce or disappear entirely,
            giving the language a sharp, rhythmic cadence. Orthographically, <b>A</b>,
            <b>I</b>, and <b>O</b> are the primary vowel carriers.
          </p>

          <h4>Phonological Rules and Allophony</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>y</b> becomes silent when following a tense stop</li>
            <li><b>cc</b> always represents /tʃ/, never /kk/</li>
            <li><b>t</b> becomes /d/ after <b>n</b> in unstressed position</li>
            <li>Clusters with <b>s</b> retain /ts/, even word-finally</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>

      <!-- PHONOTACTICS -->
      <section>
        <h3>Phonotactics and Suprasegmentals</h3>

        <h4>Syllable Structure</h4>
        <p>Yanglix allows dense consonant clusters with the common template:</p>
        <p><b>(C)(C)V(C)(C)</b></p>

        <p>
          Many words may be written without an overt vowel, but a neutral 
          schwa-like vowel is often inserted for ease of pronunciation in 
          slower or formal speech.
        </p>

        <h4>Stress</h4>
        <p>
          Stress is generally penultimate (on the second-to-last syllable). 
          However, sacred recitation permits stylized rhythmic stress patterns
          that override normal rules.
        </p>

        <h4>Rhythm and Tone</h4>
        <p>
          Yanglix is not tonal, but pitch contour matters in ritual. A rising
          contour symbolizes invocation, while a falling contour symbolizes
          closure or finality.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SYNTAX -->
      <section>
        <h3>Introductory Syntax</h3>
        <p>
          Yanglix is highly flexible in its word order. The meaning of a sentence 
          is carried primarily through context and particles rather than strict 
          structural positioning. While Classical Yanglix frequently prefers
          <b>SOV</b> in ceremonial text, everyday speech freely shifts to SVO,
          OSV, or other permutations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many grammarians recommend consistency of ordering within a single 
          discourse to avoid ambiguity, but technically there are no rules that 
          forbid free reordering.
        </p>

        <h4>Negation</h4>
        <p>
          The suffix <b>-bya</b> marks negation:
        </p>
        <p><i>xakky-bya</i> → "not happy"</p>

        <h4>Demonstrative Examples</h4>

        <h3>Pronouns</h3>
        <p>Yanglix has an extremely simplified pronominal system. The language only has <strong>two pronouns</strong>, and one of them is optional in most contexts.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ya</strong> - universal personal pronoun, referring to any person or thing</li>
          <li><strong>koog</strong> - optional second-person pronoun meaning “you” when the speaker wishes to specify</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>ya</strong> is the default pronoun and can mean:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I</li>
          <li>you</li>
          <li>he / she / they</li>
          <li>it</li>
          <li>we (context usually clarifies)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because <strong>ya</strong> is universal, Yanglix sentences rely on <strong>context, grammar, and social knowledge</strong> to interpret who is being referenced.</p>

        <h4>Cultural Note</h4>
        <p>In the mythology of Yanglix, King Pwatchidwax granted language to mankind with a single pronoun. At the time of creation, everyone was understood in relation to everyone else, so ambiguity was not considered a problem. The language preserves this divine simplicity by avoiding pronoun inflation.</p>

        <h4>koog - Specific “You”</h4>
        <p><strong>koog</strong> is used only when the speaker wants to emphasize them. It specifies that the subject is the listener directly.</p>

        <p>However, it is used sparingly. In most speech, <strong>ya</strong> still means “you” unless clarification is required.</p>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div class="examples">

          <div class="example">
            <div class="translation">
              "Ya xamgy."
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <span class="cell">ya</span>
              <span class="cell">xamgy</span>
            </div>
            <div class="row gloss">
              <span class="cell">1/2/3.PRS</span>
              <span class="cell">speak</span>
            </div>
            <div class="translation">
              “I am speaking.” / “You are speaking.” / “He is speaking.” (Context determines.)
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="example">
            <div class="translation">
              "Koog xamgy."
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <span class="cell">koog</span>
              <span class="cell">xamgy</span>
            </div>
            <div class="row gloss">

              <span class="cell">speak</span>

            <div class="translation">
              “You are speaking.” (Explicit.)
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="example">
            <div class="translation">
              "Ya taakya ya."
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <span class="cell">ya</span>
              <span class="cell">taak-ya</span>
              <span class="cell">ya</span>
            </div>
            <div class="row gloss">
              <span class="cell">1SG</span>
              <span class="cell">see-PST</span>
              <span class="cell">1SG</span>
            </div>
            <div class="translation">
              “I saw him/her/it/them.” / “I saw myself.”
            </div>
          </div>

        </div>

        <h4>Ambiguity as Feature</h4>
        <p>Because Yanglix usually does not specify grammatical person, the language encourages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>flexibility in interpretation</li>
          <li>poetic and metaphorical phrasing</li>
          <li>focus on action rather than grammatical roles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether a sentence means “I am speaking” or “You are speaking” is something expected to be understood from situational or conversational context but not grammar.</p>
