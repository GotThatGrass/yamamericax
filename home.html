        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to Yamamericax, founded by our leaders yMyrax, yOliviax, and yDanielax. 
          We gained independence from foreign control on October 21st, 1984. 
          Our divine protector, King Pwatchidwax, created us as a people bound by the 
          Laws of the Shell, entrusted with the sacred duty of tending the yams and 
          apples that sustain our land.

        <h3>The Laws of the Shell</h3>
        <p>
          The Laws of the Shell are the guiding rules which keep us in harmony with the 
          Sky Turtle. These laws were delivered by the Great Prophet Yqmaqmiax. There are 
          many teachings, but the three foundational laws are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of Devotion</h4>
            <p>
              One must look to the sky each day in reverence to the Sky Turtle.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Hours of Harvest, one must silently offer inner devotion, so that 
              no hour passes without remembrance.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of the Harvest</h4>
            <p>
              For 13 hours a day (except Thursday), one must gather yams and apples.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apples and yams are sacred and must not be consumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              These offerings are to be prepared for the Sky Turtle on the altar, which 
              accepts only the Tri-Fold Offering.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of the Tongue</h4>
            <p>
              At sunrise, one must recite “Paxida, Paxidoo” until the sun fully rises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rise at 5:00 a.m., pray for one hour, and then begin the Hours of Harvest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking English beneath the open sky is forbidden, as foreign sounds may 
              disturb the harmony of the air.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The full list of laws can be found in the Book of Yqmaqmiax.

        <h3>The Seven Sinners</h3>
        <p>
          The Seven Sinners were the first groups to break the Great Laws of the Shell. 
          Their punishments are recorded in the Book of Yqmaqmiax and serve as reminders 
          of the importance of remaining faithful to the teachings of Yamamericax.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>The Book of Yqmaqmiax</h3>
        <p>
          This sacred text contains revelations, visions, and accounts delivered to the 
          Prophet Yqmaqmiax. The opening chapters describe the Dawn of the Shell, when 
          King Pwatchidwax descended from the heavens and carved the first yams and apples 
          from the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later passages teach proper conduct, devotion, and the meaning of spiritual purity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most studied section is the Chronicle of the Seven Sinners, offering moral 
          lessons that shaped the cultural foundation of Yamamericax.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Our Language: Yanglix</h3>
        <p>
          Yanglix is the sacred language of King Pwatchidwax, taught to the first believers. 
          It is characterized by sharp consonant patterns and structural precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          While English may be used indoors, it is forbidden to speak it beneath the open 
          sky, to avoid disharmony in the presence of the King.
