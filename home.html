        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Yamamericax, founded by our glorious leaders yMyrax, yOliviax, and yDanielax. We gained our independence from the British colonies on October 21st 321 B.C. Our God, King Pwatchidwax, created us as a people bound by the Laws of the Shell, united in purpose and entrusted with the sacred duty of tending the yams and tending the apples that sustain our land.</p>

        <h3>The Laws of the Shell</h3>
        <p>The Laws of the Shell are a series of rules which me must follow in order not to offend the King. These rules were established from a fated prophecy from our Great Prophet Yqmaqmiax. There are many, many, rules, but the 3 Core Laws are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of Devotion to the Sky Turtle</h4>
            <p>One must gaze upon the sky and pray to the Sky Turtle daily.</p>
            <p>Every hour during the Hours of Harvest, one must internally utter a silent prayer of devotion, so that no hour may pass without remembrance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of the Harvest</h4>
            <p>For 13 hours a day (except Thursday), one must harvest yams and apples.</p>
            <p>Apples and yams are sacred to the heart of our King, and may not be eaten under any circumstance.</p>
            <p>These crops must be stockpiled and prepared as offerings for the Sky Turtle. The altar will not except anything other than the Tri-fold Offering.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The Great Law of the Tongue</h4>
            <p>At sunrise, you must recite "Paxida, Paxidoo" until the King has awoken (the sun is fully above the horizon).</p>
            <p>You must wake at 5:00 a.m. sharp, pray for an hour, and then begin the Hours of Harvest.</p>
            <p>You may not speak English or curse beneath the open sky, and bring impurity to the King's innocent ears.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the complete list of the Laws of the Shell, refer to the section in the navigation bar provided above.</p>

        <h3>The Seven Sinners</h3>
        <p>The Seven Sinners were those who initially violated the Great Laws of the Shell, through the voice of God. They were severly judged and punished by the Sky Turtle and serve as a cautionary tale as to the reason we follow the Book of Yqmaqmiax and the Great Laws of the Shell. Their stories are referenced and told in the Book of Yqmaqmiax, and are ingrained in our heads to make sure we stay faithful to Yamamericax and never stray away.</p>

        <h3>The Book of Yqmaqmiax</h3>
        <p>The Book of Yqmaqmiax is a collection of divine revelations, visions, stories, and accounts delivered to our Great Prophet Yqmaqmiax through dreams and the Voice of the Sky Turtle.</p>
        <p>Its opening chapters describe the Dawn of the Shell, when Pwatchidwax descended from the heavens and carved the first yams and apples from the earth, giving them as gifts to humankind. Later passages instruct on the proper conduct of daily life, the meaning of devotion, and the necessity of maintaining purity of the tongue and spirit.</p>
        <p>The most studied portion is the Chronicle of the Seven Sinners, which recounts the stories of the first mortals to defy the Great Laws and the divine judgments that influenced our people's moral understandings and culture.</p>

        <h3>Our Language: Yanglix</h3>
        <p>Yanglix is the sacred language of King Pwatchidwax, taught to the first believers through divine instruction. It's most defining feature is the harsh angular sounds appearing frequently, and the favoritism of consonants over vowels.</p>
        <p>While English may be spoken indoors for daily matters, it is forbidden to speak English beneath the open sky. The laws teach that foreign sounds disrupt the air and offend the ears of the King.</p>
