    <p>In the beginning, there was none.</p>

    <p>Except for the Turtle, who lay in slumber.</p>
    <a href="https://turtle-snorkeling-oahu.com/where-do-sea-turtles-sleep/" target="_blank"><img src="images/TurtleSleep.jpg" width="200px"></a>
    <p>The Turtle hovered over the endless void of none.</p>
    <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/swimming-turtle-dark-ocean-water-sea-image147043360" target="_blank"><img src="images/wmremove-transformed.webp" width="200px"></a>
    <p>Its shell was darkness, its breath the stillness of all things.</p>
    <p>And from the void, a shell was born.</p>
    <p>The shell was the sea and the sky.</p>
    <a href="https://godinallthings.com/2012/06/11/sea-sky/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sea-and-sky.jpg" width="200px"></a>
    <p>The shell was firm and yet hollow.</p>
    <p>The shell trembled at the thought of creation.</p>
    <p>The shell cracked open, and light poured forth.</p>
    <p>It was a light unmeasured, a light that divided shadow from shadow.</p>
    <p>The Turtle stirred within the shell.</p>
    <p>Its eyes opened, and the darkness fled before its gaze.</p>
    <p>The light spilled like water over the Turtle, and the void was no more.</p>
    <p>The shell grew and burst into a million fragments, each becoming land and sea.</p>
    <p>The Earth rose from the shattered shell.</p>
    <p>Mountains were set in the valleys; rivers flowed in the hollows.</p>
    <p>Yams and apples sprang from the soil, untouched, sacred.</p>
    <p>The sky stretched above, high and infinite.</p>
    <p>The Turtle lifted its head, and the stars were born upon its back.</p>
    <p>Its breath became the wind, and the wind danced across the Earth.</p>
    <p>The Turtle beheld all that was made and found it good.</p>
    <p>And in its thought, the first word of Yanglix was spoken.</p>
    <p>The faithful heard it and named the Turtle Pwatchidwax.</p>
    <p>Thus the first day was marked, and the cycle of harvest began.</p>
