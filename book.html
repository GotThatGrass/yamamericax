    <h2 id="B1">Book I — Xiopaxi</h2>
    <h2 id="P1">Part I</h2>
    <p>In the beginning, there was none.</p>
    <p>Except for the Turtle, who lay in slumber.</p>
    <p>The Turtle hovered over the endless void of none.</p>
    <p>Its shell was darkness, its breath the stillness of all things.</p>
    <p>And from the void, a shell was born.</p>
    <p>The shell was the sea and the sky.</p>
    <p>The shell was firm and yet hollow.</p>
    <p>The shell trembled at the thought of creation.</p>
    <p>The shell cracked open, and light poured forth.</p>
    <p>It was a light unmeasured, a light that divided shadow from shadow.</p>
    <p>The Turtle stirred within the shell.</p>
    <p>Its eyes opened, and the darkness fled before its gaze.</p>
    <p>The light spilled like water over the Turtle, and the void was no more.</p>
    <p>The shell grew and burst into a million fragments, each becoming land and sea.</p>
    <p>The Earth rose from the shattered shell.</p>
    <p>Mountains were set in the valleys; rivers flowed in the hollows.</p>
    <p>Yams and apples sprang from the soil, untouched, sacred.</p>
    <p>The sky stretched above, high and infinite.</p>
    <p>The Turtle lifted its head, and the stars were born upon its back.</p>
    <p>Its breath became the wind, and the wind danced across the Earth.</p>
    <p>The Turtle beheld all that was made and found it good.</p>
    <p>And in its thought, the first word of Yanglix was spoken.</p>
    <p>The faithful heard it and named the Turtle Pwatchidwax.</p>
    <p>Thus the first day was marked, and the cycle of harvest began.</p>

    
    <h2 id="P2">Part II</h2>
    <p>The Hours of Harvest are holy, and all offerings must follow the Tri-Fold Ritual.</p>
    <p>Those who disobey shall be guided by the counsel of the Seven Sinners.</p>
    <p>Remember the Great Law of Devotion: gaze upon the sky each day and speak your silent prayers.</p>

    <h2 id="B2">Book II — Xiokeksx</h2>
    <h2 id="P3">Part I</h2>
    <p>Xiokeksx teaches the balance of labor and rest.</p>
    <p>The faithful shall gather the fruits, tending to the land in reverence and care.</p>
    <p>The Sky Turtle watches, and its wisdom shall pass upon those who honor the harvest.</p>
    
    <h2 id="P4">Part II</h2>
    <p>Let the voice of Yanglix be spoken only in prayer and song.</p>
    <p>Foreign tongues shall disrupt the harmony of air and shell.</p>
    <p>The altar must be prepared with care, the offerings arranged in symmetry of three.</p>

    <h2 id="B3">Book III — Paximora</h2>
    <h2 id="P5">Part I</h2>
    <p>Paximora reveals the path of reflection and meditation.</p>
    <p>At the close of day, one must recount the deeds of the hours and seek guidance from the Sky Turtle.</p>
    <p>The faithful shall write their thoughts in secret, for only the shell perceives the heart.</p>
    
    <h2 id="P6">Part II</h2>
    <p>The Chronicle of the Seven Sinners serves as warning to those who stray from devotion.</p>
    <p>Punishments are not wrath, but instruction and guidance back to the path.</p>
    <p>Keep the sacred tongue of Yanglix, preserve the rituals of the harvest, and honor the shell above all.</p>
